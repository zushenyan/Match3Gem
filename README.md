Match3Gem
=========

Play it [here](http://zushenyan.github.io/Match3Gem/dist/html/index.html).

A match-3 simple puzzle game aims for practicing JavaScript & Phaser.

Originally it was written with Cocos2d-html5, but after browsers updated, it became not runnable anymore with the old 2.1.5 version.

My assumption is that Cocos2d-html5 used some experimental features which were deprecated in newer browsers.

Although upgrading it to 2.3.x version can make it work again, functions' behavior has changed, which leads to unexpected results and painful bug tracking.

Since Cocos2d-html5 has been merged with Cocos2d-JS not long ago and 3+ version has been redeisgned, learning the new one means learning an totally new framework to me, so why not start over? That's why it was rewritten with Phaser.

Support Platforms
