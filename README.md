Match3Gem
=========
A match-3 simple puzzle game aims for practice of JavaScript & Phaser.

Originally it was written with Cocos2d-html5, but after a period of time, it became not runnable with old 2.1.5 version.

I guess it's because it used some experimental features in browsers that were deprecated latter.

Though upgrading to version 2.3.x can bring my game alive again, some behaviors were changed, which leads to some unexpected results and painful bug tracing work.

Now, Cocos2d-html5 is merged with Cocos2d-JS and since its 3+ version has almost complete new design structure, it's almost like learning an new framework to me, so why not start over? That's why the game was reborn with Phaser.
